				"Description: This course will explore the automated design of autonomous machines using evolutionary algorithms. The course will cover relevant topics in evolutionary computation, artificial neural networks, robotics, biomechanics, and simulation. Students will conduct a major programming project that will span the course and thus provide hands-on experience with the topics covered. Undergraduates will use their developed system to perform a pre-specified evolutionary robotics experiment; graduate students will formulate their own research hypothesis and use their system to test that hypothesis.\r\n" +

				"Ten programming assignments (10Ã—4=40%): Over the span of ten weeks, each student will gradually build a software system that allows them to conduct an evolutionary robotics experiment. This system will be composed of 10 software modules. Each programming assignment will involve implementing one of these modules. Note: Because the modules will form a final, integrated system, if you fail to hand in one assignment, you must hand it in along with the new assignment the following week.\r\n" +
